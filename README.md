# Docker-Dashboard
---

## This is a dashboard app for docker.
It runs on your local machine and connects to docker instances to give feed back on stats and running states. It allows you to stop and start docker instances, as well as create new ones. This is an on going play project for myself as I work more with the MEAN stack. Feel free to do with it as you like.

Currently, there are several unnecessary dev dependencies for Angular, but I plan on integrating Angular into parts (or adding other stuff in Angular) once I have completed the React build-out.

## Tech-Stack
The server is ExpressJS, the primary index page is comprised of React components. Babel, gulp, and webpack are used to transform the es6 JSX modules into regular JS.

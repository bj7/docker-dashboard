# Docker-Dashboard
---

## This is a dashboard app for docker.
It runs on your local machine and connects to docker instances to give feed back on stats and running states. It allows you to stop and start docker instances, as well as create new ones. This is an on going play project for myself as I work more with the MEAN stack. Feel free to do with it as you like.
